# ModelService

> The *ModelService* declaratively provisions and maintains the Kubernetes resources needed to serve a base model for inference.

A *ModelService* custom resource encapsulates the desired state of deployments and routing associated with a single base model. It automates the management of Kubernetes resources, including:

* Prefill and decode deployments

* Inference pool and model defined by [Gateway API Inference Extension](https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io)

* Endpoint picker (EPP) deployment and service

* Relevant RBAC permissions

A *ModelService* may optionally reference a **BaseConfig** ‚Äî a Kubernetes ConfigMap that defines reusable, platform-managed presets for shared behavior across multiple base models.

Typically, platform operators define a small set of *BaseConfig* presets, and base model owners reference them in their respective *ModelService* resources.

The *ModelService* controller reconciles the cluster state to align with the configuration declared in the *ModelService* custom resource. This custom resource is the source of truth for resources it owns.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do not manually modify resources owned by a *ModelService*. If your use case is not yet supported, please file an issue in the *ModelService* repository.

## Features

‚úÖ Supports disaggregated prefill and decode workloads

üåê Integrates with Gateway API Inference Extension for request routing

üìà Enables auto-scaling via HPA or custom controllers

üîß Allows independent scaling and node affinity for prefill and decode deployments

üì¶ Supports model loading from:

* OCI images

* HuggingFace (public or private)

* Kubernetes PVCs

üß© Supports value templating in both BaseConfig and ModelService

## How It Works

When a ModelService is reconciled:

1. **Templating**: Template variables in *BaseConfig* and *ModelService* are interpolated based on the *ModelService* spec.

2. **Merging**: A semantic merge overlays *ModelService* values on top of the selected *BaseConfig*.

3. **Resource Deployment**: The controller creates or updates the following:

* Inference deployments (prefill and decode)

* Routing resources (e.g., EPP deployment)

* RBAC authorizations

The result is a fully managed inference stack for the base model.

## Best Practices

* Use *BaseConfig* to capture platform-level defaults and shared configurations across multiple base models.

* Use *ModelService* to define behavior specific to a given base model, and override *BaseConfig* values only when necessary.

* Platform teams should install *Baseconfig* presets using the `llm-d` deployer.

* Base model owners should prefer using these presets to streamline onboarding of base models, rather than creating their own custom *BaseConfigs*.


<!-- ## Samples

Refer to the [`samples` folder](samples).

## Run `ModelService` locally

### Create kind cluster

```sh
kind create cluster
```
### Install InferenceModels and InferencePool CRDs

```sh
VERSION=v0.3.0
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/releases/download/$VERSION/manifests.yaml
```

### Running controller

```sh
make install && make run
```

### Uninstall

```sh
make uninstall && make undeploy 
```

### Delete cluster
```sh
kind delete cluster
```

### ModelService dry run
View the components that ModelService will create given a ModelService CR and a base config ConfigMap. 

Make sure you are at the root directory of `llm-d-model-service`

```
cd llm-d-model-service
go run main.go generate --modelservice <path-to-msvc-cr> --baseconfig <path-to-baseconfig>
```

For example

```
go run main.go generate -m samples/facebook/msvc.yaml -b samples/facebook/baseconfig.yaml > output.yaml
```

And `output.yaml` will contain the YAML manifest for the resources that ModelService will create in the cluster. This feature purely for development purposes, and is intended to provide a quick way of debugging without a cluster. Note that some fields will not be included, such as `owner references` and `name` which require a cluster. -->
